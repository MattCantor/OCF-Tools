CURRENT CHECKS:
Check that equity_compensation issuance in incoming security_id referenced by transaction exists in current state.
The date of the equity_compensation issuance referred to in the security_id must have a date equal to or earlier than the date of the equity_compensation exercise
Any stock issuances with corresponding security IDs referred to in the resulting_security_ids array must exist
The security_id of the equity_compensation issuance referred to in the security_id variable must not be the security_id related to any other transactions with the exception of a equity_compensation acceptance transaction.
The dates of any equity_compensation issuances referred to in the resulting_security_ids variables must have a date equal to the date of the equity_compensation exercise
The stakeholder_id of the equity_compensation issuance referred to in the security_id variable must equal the stakeholder_id of any stock issuances referred to in the resulting_security_ids variable

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
The quantity_converted variable must equal the sum of any equity_compensation issuances referred to in the resulting_security_ids variable
